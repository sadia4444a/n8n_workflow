Exploring n8n: AI-Powered Workflow Automation 🤖

I recently created a simple smart automation workflow in n8n that integrates with Telegram, Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Sheets to streamline daily tasks. Here's how it works:

✅ Fetch & Summarize Emails 
✅ Schedule Calendar Events 
✅ Find & Send Emails 
✅ Retrieve Upcoming Events 

All of this is triggered via Telegram, making it super easy to interact with! Just type a request, and the AI agent handles the rest.
